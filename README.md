# Space tourism multi-page website


This website is a chanllenge from [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).

It's demonstrated also as tutorial in [FreeCode Camp Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRaL-8qZ0mM&t=317s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) by [kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell/space-tourism/commits?author=kevin-powell).

The purpose of the tutorial was *how to create a system design* using css.

I solved this challenge by using React instead of creating a typical HTML page.
